# Cyrill's Github Page

Welcome!

My name is Cyrill PÃ¼ntener. I've a bachelor's degree in computer science and I am currently in my graduate studies in CS at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. In my free time, I'm active in developing different open-source projects, 
most of them connected with [Cevi Schweiz](https://github.com/cevi).
